        Technology is constantly evolving, and so is my journey of learning. My
        education has provided a strong foundation in <strong

          >problem-solving</strong

        believe in <strong>continuous learningâ€”through experience</strong>,
        research, and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies. Here's
        a look at my <strong
