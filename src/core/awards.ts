            'When it comes to developer experience, the most important factor in evaluating and learning new technologies is time to first success. In the CMS world, the first success happens when you get your development environment working and able to create content in the back-office and view it in the front. eZ Launchpad is one of the solutions for making this time as short as possible. Installing and configuring a complete stack for eZ Platform can be challenging and time-consuming if you have not done it many times. With eZ Launchpad you can get this stack up and running, and ready for real development in just a few minutes.',

            'We won this award because of the new e-commerce subscription system implementation of "The Economist" using eZ Platform as the Content Marketing CMS, as the journey builder, and as the Product and Campaign tool to empower the Marketing. The implementation also uses the power of Symfony 2.x stack (provided by the CMS) to manage millions of orders and users in a noSQL database. It is our biggest e-commerce project based on eZ, it shows the extensibility of the product and the robustness. The challenges were multiples and what we have done is a small part of a large ecosystem of tools that are used at The Economist to deliver their contents and subscriptions. The project is not done yet and as the CTO of The Economist said before winning this award: "The product is born when the project is launched; it\'s not finished". A lot more challenges are coming! And we are ready!',
